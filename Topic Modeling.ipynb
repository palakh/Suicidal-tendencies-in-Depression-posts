Who am i kidding. I have a girlfriend who i love but she is the same boat as me. Lost at sea. We both lived in abusive homes. And we never had much of an opportunity to grow. My mom didnt try to work with me. When i was shipped to boarding school i felt like this was a chance to start over, and it was for a year. When i came back home i lost my first girlfriend, my hest friend, and my father figure. Gone. I had to grow up with that loss. As a kid i didnt really think how abusive my mother was. Just my father. I reflect now when i sit on my old broken mattress with duct tape covering the exposed springs how my mother may have had an impact on my mental health. She was just so controlling every aspect of my life had to fall into her agenda. She wanted me to be rich so i could buy her a house, get her citizenship, she wanted me to go to university and get job. She built me to make me belive i was a prodigy, but i was just some kid who like comic books not some genius. She grew up worse than me i cant blame her for trying to get out of her misrable past but at the cost of her first son? Idk how to feel about that. . And of course i wasnt the perfect kid. When i came back from boardibg school music was an escape. Then drinking. Then heroine. Not proud of what i did. Going to high school and dealing with withdrawals but when i was high i was happy. Everything faded and i was fine. I OD when i was 16 or 17 that was a wake up call. Been off of it since wasnt easy either. I miss being happy that feeling, but not that drug. My girlfriend is sleeping on our twin bed i watch her sleep because she looks so at peace. Happy. Beautiful.  But i treat her like shit sometimes because my anger gets to me. And when the smoke clears i just break down. I say sorry for what i say. Sometimes i feel she will realize im just a deadbeat like my father and leave. I wouldnt blame her. I am employed though.  I lost my job on my birthday prior. And it took my 3 months to find another. Now i make around a 1000 a month give or take. I live in California. And i rent a room with my mom of course. Which doesnt help. Before i was let go from my previous job. I was placed on a 5150. Not a proud moment. All the docs said i had to escape. Find another place to live. How? I cant afford to live in this state nor can i afford to leave. Im stuck. My girlfriend says im a ticking time bomb waiting to explode i fear that. I fear i might hurt myself somtimes. So i can get out of the mess I put myself in. But then my girlfriend will be alone. Her greatest fear. Idk why im even righting this to be quite honest. But fuck man. I lost my grip and now i cant seem to get a hold of things. Im going to have to kove by the end of this month. The landord evicted my mom. So that means i gotta go too. I just hope my brothers wont have to put up with this kind of stuff. So they dont turn out like me. Maybe its just my way of thinking. Idk. Im just constantly sad. I dont seem to get much enjoyment in things anymore so i dont see the point in trying you know perhaps thats part of the problem. Or its just me. Just me. All i can do is self loathe because i forgot how to snap out of it. I forgot how to smile. How to ge kind. How to get out of bed once the alarm rings. How to be happy.

       " 'Its a long drought out story but im 29 and still live with my parents for a multitude of reasons most mainly concerns are for my mental health and Ive suffered from severe depression for a total of eight long years. I would not make it on my own. That and I suffer from social anxiety of being around people. And even talking to people for example if someone were to talk with me the conversation wouldn\\'t go on for as long as you think and it will end abruptly due to me not really saying anything and it gets awkward. And well, ever since I was about 22, Ive been through at least six low wage jobs of sorts. Some were ok but unfulfilling as always. Three of which I was let go of due to being depressed in my life as I couldn\\'t figure out why. I think its mainly because I felt like I didn\\'t know where I belonged in my life, or what I should do. And it ended making me feel pretty worthless. Fast forward to eight years later as of now, it hasn\\'t been a good year for me. During the last six months I was experiencing panic attacks almost every night and it was such a race against time to get maybe at least 2 or even three hours of sleep before the time reads 5am. Its amazing how fast time goes by when you have a panic attack for a few hours in the middle of the night...that and plus it gave me suicidal thoughts. Thoughts only though, and never acted upon doing. \\n\\nSo, as of July, I am now currently on short term leave. Might extended to long term disability due to how progress is going. I did meet up with a psychologist back in May though and have been seeing her ever since. Been put on medication, etc. And also been into the hospital...TWICE in two days. Once was when I was in my doctors office because she felt like I really needed to go and I was really scared.. never had been forced to go before but I cooperated of course and everything. And well.. they didn\\'t really do anything for me. My worst fear was being put into the psych ward which honestly..that would of made me feel so much worse being around other people and all. Its just a depressing place and doesn\\'t leave a good reflection when I went in there for an evaluation for IOP. But anyways... yes. Thats what the hospital suggested. IOP of course. But there was a huge problem.. I couldn\\'t afford it even with insurance. So they handed me papers and off I went into the night at 3am. My parents were worried of course as well and they knew I was depressed but they didn\\'t really knew I was suicidal either. I couldn\\'t have ever told them I was even when they asked me if I was. I couldn\\'t ever look them in the eye and tell them such a thing because I didn\\'t want them to ever worry about me. I care too much for them to worry. Next day comes along, my doctor calls me and found out what happened. Tells my parents of course. They get involved too and the next thing I knew after I came back from my cycling was that my mom told me that we need to go to the hospital. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt was either that, or they would call 911. I agreed because my mom was in tears at the time fearing for my life. I couldn\\'t say no... so here I was again. In the same hospital. But only this time it was worse with a different shift. They forgot about me at one point for four hours as I asked what happened? And at least a nurse gave me the decency to tell me the information went through the cracks. I was already pissed off at this point because I barely even had any sleep from the previous day... so in comes the electronic pad with the sykpe call as before with another psych doctor asking the same questions and so on...then he asks me \"what can we do for you?\" Really? What can they do for me? Im a patient suffering from severe depression and panic attacks with suicidal thoughts, im seeing my main doctor three times a week, im on medications and he has the gull to ask me \"what can we do for you\"? I was confused at this point..didn\\'t really know what to even say so I said nothing... it was just all the same process repeated itself all over again I realized. They gave me some papers on how to manage suicidal thoughts, again. And they sent me on my way home. This was all just in part of one doctor who became scared for me and me finding out later that her intentions was so that the hospital would send me to the psych ward. Im honestly not sure about this doctor though. I have two at the same place. This one prescribes my meds, is a social worker and does ask the same questions as any other doctor. Then there is my main psychologist doctor I see which I feel more open to.  Thats the one I see three times a week. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo, anyways..its the middle of August now. Our cat had to be put down just the other day... And its been kind of a wild ride I guess with all of that. I realized that maybe I cant really handle life sometimes I suppose. It helps to talk with my doctor. The meds seem to be calming me down a bit too. I have panic attacks only often which I think is a good improvement and the thought of suicide is non existent for now. My main doctor worries for me it seems. She a really nice older lady whom I came to really open up to since its always been hard to talk sometimes with my parents about this kind of stuff. Both of which love me so very much. But my dad sometimes gets angry at things which don\\'t ever help. Not all the time. Says things he doesn\\'t mean too... my mom is more open though. But, at the end of the day, they have a heart of gold though. And im truly thankful for everything they ever done for me knowing how shitty their upbringing was. Even if they are hard to get along with sometimes, Ill always love them no matter what. I don\\'t even know where Id be if it wasn\\'t for them... Anyways, just the other day, I went to this place where they help disabled people like me help and maintain a job. Its a service they provide for pretty much any disabled person and job training too. I don\\'t know what im good at really but maybe they can help with that I hope. My last job was working at a factory. I think Ive had my fair share of them here in Cleveland and its definitely a place where I cannot see myself in the next 40 years of my life. The flip  side is that I actually feel like I can breath again too being away from that place...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBut the reality is that I still need medical insurance to keep seeing my doctor, and my meds. And of course an income from disability. Ill probably try to apply for disability as well in the meantime. And apply for a long term disability with my work place so I don\\'t lose insurance at this point. And so, thats the way it is. I really want to keep seeing my doctor though. Not a different one. She is also helping me with my dissociation which I tend to do a lot as well. Another part of my depression that has to be worked out of sorts. The feeling of dissociation for me is that its like staring off into space. But in this instance, its like im being in the third person on the outside while my mind goes blank. Fully aware of what my surroundings are though and the conversation being had. Its just feeling like your trapped in some kind of limbo as the time goes on thinking if you are ever going to snap out of it. Its one of the worst things Ive ever had been dealing with but like I said, we are working on it too. I guess thats almost pretty much everything though with the struggles I went through so far with my depression... Im doing ok for now which is good. Better then being terrible. Also... on a side note here, Im going to take a Bob Ross instructor class in a few days. In the many years Ive watched Bob Ross since I was a kid in the 90\\'s and until now, I seriously want to paint a portrait. I never had the desire to until just last night for some reason... I think its going to be a good thing for me though honestly even though I was never an artist, lol.',\n",

Having a plan for a solid personality core and heart foundation was ideal in getting me to be unshakeable against external crap.\\n\\nAlso, when the dirty thoughts come, do you let them ride or try to suppress them? I never found that to work. At least for me, confronting, then banishing, then replacing the thoughts over several months (CBT style) was the only thing I found to reverse the effects of the dirty voice messing with my thoughts and actions.\\n\\nAnd finally about girls, I totally feel you there, too. They like it when guys are strong and still mix it with intelligence and kindness, from my experience. It seems like you got the kindness and smarts down pat, so how is your power going? It's great you got a car, but are you currently lifting, working on social skill to be more charming and interesting, practicing thought control to stay focused and confident, that kind of thing? And better yet, getting a motorcycle on top of it all? That last one was the absolute cherry on the top of the power cake I was baking that got me more proactive lady attention than anything else. :D\",\n",
