## INTRODUCTION
Reddit Suicide watch is a peer-support group launched in December 2008. It has over 195k members from all around the world. It brings together people who are victims of depression and suicide providing a safe place to talk about their feelings and provide the emotional support they otherwise lack.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
It is very crucial to identify suicidal tendencies in people therefore we can provide help at an early stage. If we can analyze how posts of victims of suicidal and tendencies differ, identifying suicidal tendencies in a depressed individual is possible. We implemented multiple NLP algorithms to understand more about the type of words, their similarity etc. 

## MODELS USED
* **Sentiment-Analysis** 
* **MDS Visualization on posts**
* **Cosine-Similarity** 
* **TF-IDF vectorization**
* **Topic Modeling using LDA** 

## Results
* Sentiment analysis validates that the suicide watch platform on reddit provides a positive environment for people lacking support at home or who prefer to be anonymous 
* TF-IDF shows top identifying words vary between suicide and depression
* LDA shows dominant topics vary between suicide and depression
* Depression - Posts more focused on extreme emotions such as sadness, anger, hatred. Many self-harms mention. 
* Suicide - Posts more resigned, stoic, and emphasize external influences on decisions

## Future Recommendations
There have been multiple studies where if depression not treated for long durations can mature into having suicidal tendencies.
Throughout analysis, we can observe the stark difference between people who are suffering from depression and suicidal tendencies. These models can be used to identify victims of suicidal tendencies on depression posts and provide help at an earlier stage.
